# JSE

## Description
Efficient Haskell port of Ruby's [http://rubygems.org/gems/jse](JSE) JSON
Stream editor. I started this project to possibly improve on the original's API
and to teach myself about the Enumerator pattern, Blaze Builder and stream
editing in Haskell. 

## Building
`make`

## Usage
`bin/jse --help`

## Status
Filtering is currently not working. Test suite is not in place. Don't use it
for important stuff yet. Need to work on using cabal to install dependencies
